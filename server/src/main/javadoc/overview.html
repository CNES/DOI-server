    A Digital Object Identifier or DOIs are in use mainly to identify academic, 
    professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research 
    reports and data sets, and official publications.<br/>

    The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, 
    whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online 
    document by its DOI provides more stable linking than simply using its 
    URL, because if its URL changes, the publisher only needs to update the 
    metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL.    
    
    <p>
    A DOI is a persistent identifier, represented by an alphanumeric string 
    assigned to uniquely identify an object. It is tied to a metadata description 
    of the object as well as to a digital location, such as a URL, where all the 
    details about the object are accessible.<br/>

    <p>       
    A DOI name is divided into three parts, separated by the first two slashes ('/'):<br/>

    <br/>    
    A DOI aims to be "resolvable" by the proxy. This is achieved by binding the 
    DOI to metadata about the object, such as a URL, indicating where the object 
    can be found. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs 
    from identifiers such as ISBNs and ISRCs which aim only to uniquely identify
    their referents.<br/><br/>
    A DOI prefix always starts with '10.' and continues with a number (e.g. '10.1234' or '10.20865').
    The DOI prefix is used as a namespace so that DOIs are globally unique without
    requiring global coordination for every new identifier. Prefixes in the handle
    system and therefore all DOIs prefixes are numbers without any semantic meaning.
    The prefix is a unique number attributed by DataCite for a given organization.<br/><br/>
    The suffix for a DOI can be (almost) any string. Each suffix must be unique within
    the organization and is defined by the following list of characters : <i>A-Z a-z 0-9
        - . _ : / +</i>                
    
    <p>
    This document provides the description of the DOI server. it aims is to provide
    a common service to an organization so that each project of this organization
    can manage its own DOI according to their own access rights. The access
    rights are defined by the DOI server whereas the real creation of a DOI is
    handled between the DOI server and the DataCite API by a unique login/password.
    Moreover, the DOI server guarantees an unique identifer in the whole organization
    at condition that the project guarantees an unique identifier in its own project.
