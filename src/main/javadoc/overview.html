    A Digital Object Identifier or DOI is a persistent identifier, represented
    by an alphanumeric string assigned to uniquely identify an objects It is 
    tied to a metadata description of the object as well as to a digital 
    location, such as a URL, where all the details about the object are 
    accessible.<br/>

    <p>       
    DOIs are in use mainly to identify academic, professional, and government 
    information, such as journal articles, research reports and data sets, and 
    official publications.
    
    <p>       
    A DOI aims to be "resolvable". This is achieved by binding the 
    DOI to metadata about the object, such as a URL, indicating where the object 
    can be found. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs 
    from identifiers such as ISBNs and ISRCs which aim only to uniquely identify
    their referents.
    
    <p>
    The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, 
    whereas its location and other metadata may change. 
    Referring to an online document by its DOI provides more stable linking than 
    simply using its URL, because if its URL changes, the publisher only needs 
    to update the metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL.        
    
    <p>
    This document provides the description of the DOI server. it aims is to provide
    a common service to an organization so that each project of this organization
    can manage its own DOI according to their own access rights. The access
    rights are defined by the DOI server whereas the real creation of a DOI is
    handled between the DOI server and the DataCite API by a unique login/password.
    Moreover, the DOI server guarantees an unique identifer in the whole organization
    at condition that the project guarantees an unique identifier in its own project.
